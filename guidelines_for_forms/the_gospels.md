## The Gospels

1. The gospels were each written to different Christian communities with different needs and therefore emphasize different aspects of Jesus’ life and teaching.
The authors’ concern was not only to tell the historical story of Jesus, but to tell it in a way that was intelligible to the audience addressed and that met their specific needs.

2. The stories and sayings of Jesus were transmitted orally over a period of perhaps thirty years, and some were written down without a description of their contexts.
Many of Jesus’ sayings were available to the evangelists and it was the evangelists themselves, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, who gave the sayings their present contexts.

3. Some of Jesus’ teaching passages are collections of His sayings that speak to the same basic topic.
They were probably not spoken together as it would appear and therefore may not strongly connect in
a flow of thought.
For example, some of Matthews nicely-collected sayings are scattered all over Luke’s gospel.

4. Mark was written first and Luke and Matthew essentially copied large sections of it.
(This is substantiated on pages 122-123 of How to Read the Bible for all it’s Worth)

5. Comparing parallel passages may give insight into Matthew or Luke’s concerns and intentions as we notice how they alter or embellish Mark.
In other words, the evangelists were authors, not merely compilers and what they compiled and how they did so can give us clues as to their intent.

6. Jesus teaches that the kingdom of God would not come all at once as the Jews were expecting, but would be inaugurated gradually.
The kingdom of God is at hand (being revealed in their midst) but it’s fullness will not come until later.

7. True parables (stories from start to finish) were intended to powerfully hammer home one particular point.
They tend to have an unexpected twist for an ending, similar to a joke

8. To determine the point of the parable, we must determine the main points of reference (people or things) and the unexpected turn in the story.
